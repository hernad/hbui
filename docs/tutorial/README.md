# **Welcome to project HBUI**

### Hello!
If we are going to spend a few hours together, I propose - call me Rafa≈Ç. I will add more only that this project was created by my good friends from the group Harbour - Teo, Viktor, Bogdan. I am impressed clarity, simplicity and logical programming in Harbour so I propose you to spend a few moments in the land of programming Harbour with me.

### Preliminary assumptions
This tutorial is designed for beginners who are getting started the adventure with Harbour, and I think that If I make mistake, you will correct me.

### My friends from the group Harbour
I invite everyone to build this guide and build project HBUI.


# Instaling in Linux
I would like to present Linux distribution called "Elementary". It is user-friendly, simple and at the same time nicely presents the operating system. This is of course free like every non-commercial Linux distribution. Don't worry if you never use the system under the sign of the penguin Tux because this is also a good suggestion to start.

### We start
Open a terminal window and write:
```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```
Elementary doesn't have `cmake` so you need to install it:
```
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
```
GTK+ is a cross-platform widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
```
Installation Harbour. The compilation may take a few minutes:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/harbour/core.git harbour
$ cd harbour
$ make
```
Change directory:
```
$ cd
```
Installation libui:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/andlabs/libui
$ cd libui
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
Change directory:
```
$ cd
```
Installation HBUI:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rjopek/hbui
```
Run text editor:
```
$ vi .profile
```
and write in: **export HB_WITH_LIBUI="$HOME/libui"**

Open root account which is administrator of the system and then run text editor:
```
# vi /etc/ld.so.conf
```
and write in: **/home/username/libui/build/out** <br>
username = is your user name for example, on my Linux it is so: **/home/rafa/libui/build/out**
```
# reboot
```
Now we can proceed to compile hbui:
```
$ cd hbui
$ hbmk2 hbui.hbp
$ cd samples
$ hbmk2 01.prg -run
```
# Instaling in Windows
Welcome after the break. I hope that holidays were successful. Some people say that programming Windows is boring, undemanding and the programmer is wasted.

### We start
Install Microsoft Visual Studio Express is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft.
Visual Studio Community. [Download](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-express/)

Then install
`cmake` you can download [here](https://cmake.org/download/) <br>
start a command line and write:
```
c:\>cmake --version
cmake version 3.7.0-rc1
```
Then install
`make` you can download [here](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) <br>
start a command line and write:
```
c:\>make --version
GNU Make 3.81
```
In both cases it should show version, if don't,  you need to add the variable - PATH

Now let's go to the Visual Studio after startup, select from the menu: <br>
Tools->External Tools... configure to your need, click Add and in the empty field, write:
- Title: HBUI
- Command: c:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
- Arguments: /k "c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat"
- Initial directory: c:\hbui\samples
- Apply OK

Now we can start again from the menu Tools->HBUI:
```
c:\hbui\samples>
```

and go to the catalog where you installed `libui` and follow the instructions:
```
c:\libui>mkdir build
c:\libui>cd build
c:\libui\build>cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
c:\libui\build>make
```

We can build examples for libui:
```
c:\libui\build>make examples
```

Now we can proceed to compilation our library:
```
c:\hbui>set HB_WITH_LIBUI=c:\libui
c:\hbui>hbmk2 hbui.hbp
c:\hbui>cd samples
c:\hbui\samples>hbmk2 01.prg -run
```

Remember, you have to do a compilation Harbour from Visual Studio !!!

### Binary download

Harbour binary download from this page and unpack:
- [Harbour binary](http://harbour.edu.pl/hbui/hb32.zip)
unpack the:
```
C:\hb32
```

HBUI binary download from this page and unpack:
- [HBUI binary](http://harbour.edu.pl/hbui/hbui.zip)
unpack the:
```
c:\hbui
```

libui binary download from this page and unpack:
- [libui binary](http://harbour.edu.pl/hbui/libui.zip)
unpack the:
```
c:\libui
```

For the sake of peace of mind ;-) <br>
Set the environment variables `set PATH=c:\libui\build\out` or then copy library `libui.dll`

Open a developer command prompt

If you have installed Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 10, open the Start menu and choose All apps. Scroll down and open the Visual Studio 2015 folder (not the Visual Studio 2015 app). Choose Developer Command Prompt for VS2015 to open the command prompt window.
If you have installed Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools 2015 on Windows 10, open the Start menu and choose All apps. Scroll down and open the Visual C++ Build Tools folder. Choose Visual C++ 2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt to open the command prompt window.

In the developer command prompt window, enter
```
C:\>cd hbui\samples
c:\hbui\samples>hbmk2 01.prg -run
```

The only mistake lies in that I'm not able to perceive what it is that someone else did. ;-)

Do not worry, will be an easier way compilation.
